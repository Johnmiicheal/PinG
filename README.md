# PiNG

Built using JavaScript=> [Peer.js](https://peerjs.com/) 
<br/>
<br/>
PeerJS wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer connection API. Equipped with nothing but an ID, a peer can create a P2P data or media stream connection to a remote peer.

<br/>
<br/>
## USAGE
* Include the library ``` <script src="https://unpkg.com/peerjs@1.4.5/dist/peerjs.min.js"></script> ```
* Create a peer ``` var peer = new Peer(); ```

## TODO
* Build a better user interface

* Add socket and routing so you can select online peers and ping them


Inspired by George Hotz: He also did something similar on his live stream...
